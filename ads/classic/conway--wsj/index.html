                  <p>On a beautiful late spring afternoon, twenty-five years ago, two young men graduated from the same college. They were very much alike, these two young men. Both had been better than average students, both were personable and both—as young college graduates are—were filled with ambitious dreams for the future.</p>
                  <p>Recently, these men returned to their college for their 25th reunion.</p>
                  <p>They were still very much alike. Both were happily married. Both had three children. And both, it turned out, had gone to work for the same Midwestern manufacturing company after graduation, and were still there.</p>
                  <p>But there was a difference. One of the men was manager of a small department of that company. The other was its president.</p>
                  <h3>What made the difference</h3>
                  <p>Have you ever wondered, as I have, what makes this kind of difference in people’s lives? It isn’t always a native intelligence or talent or dedication. It isn’t that one person wants success and the other doesn’t.</p>
                  <p>The difference lies in what each person knows and how he or she makes use of that knowledge.</p>
                  <p>And that is why I am writing to you and to people like you about The Wall Street Journal. For that is the whole purpose of The Journal: To give its readers knowledge – knowledge that they can use in business.</p>
                  <h3>A Publication Unlike Any Other</h3>
                  <p>You see, The Wall Street Journal is a unique publication. It’s the country’s only national business daily. Each business day, it is put together by the world’s largest staff for business-news experts.</p>
                  <p>Each business day, The Journal’s pages include a broad range of information of interest and significance to business-minded people, no matter where it comes from. <span class="underline">Not just stocks and finance</span>, but anything and everything in the whole, fast-moving world of business. . .The Wall Street Journal gives you all the business news you need—when you need it.</p>
                  <h3>Knowledge Is Power</h3>
                  <p>Right now, I am looking at page one of The Journal, the best-read front page in America. It combines all the important news of the day with in-depth feature report-ing. Every phase of business news is covered. I see articles on new inflation, wholesale prices, car prices, tax incentives for industries to major developments in Washington, and elsewhere.</p>
                  <p>The Journal is also the single best source for news and statistics about your money. In the <span class="underline">Money &amp; Investing</span> section there are helpful charts, easy-to-scan market quotations, plus &quot;Abreast of the Market,&quot; &quot;Heard on the Street&quot; and &quot;Your Money Matters,&quot; three of America&#x27;s most influential and carefully read investment columns.. </p>
                  <p>Much of the information that appears in The Journal appears nowhere else. The Journal is printed in numerous plants across the United States, so that you get it early each business day.</p>
                  <h3>A Money-Saving Subscription</h3>
                  <p>Put our statements to the proof by subscribing for the next 13 weeks for just $28. This is the shortest subscription term we offer – and a perfect way to get acquainted with The Journal.</p>
                  <p>Or you may prefer to take advantage of a longer-term subscription for greater savings: an annual subscription at $107 saves you $20 off The Journal’s cover price. Our best buy -—two years for $185 - saves you a full $69!</p>

And here’s The Journal guarantee: Should The Journal not measure up to your expectations, you may cancel this trial arrangement at any point and receive a refund for the undelivered portion of your subscription.</p>

                  <p>About those two college classmates, I mention at the beginning of this letter. They graduated from college together and together got started in the business world. So what made their lives in business different?</p>
                  <p>Knowledge. Useful knowledge. And its application.</p>
                  <h3>An Investment In Success</h3>
                  <p>I cannot promise you that success will be instantly yours if you start reading The Wall Street Journal. But I can guarantee that you will find The Journal always interesting, always reliable, and always useful.</p>
                  <p>Sincerely,</p>
