              <h4 class="futura-h4">And how many times have you had to lose a full night’s TV entertainment—because you had to call a repairman who couldn’t come “till tomorrow”?</h4>
              <h4 class="poster-h4">90% OF THESE BREAKDOWNS <span class="h4-breaker">ARE UNNECESSARY</span></h4>
              <div class="rich-text w-richtext">
                <p>All of these breakdowns may have seemed tragic to you at the moment they happened — but HERE is the real tragedy! Do you know that the same exact set that you now have in your front room— no matter what its brand name or model—has been playing in manufacturer’s test rooms for months— <strong>and playing perfectly!</strong></p>
                <p>These sets have been subjected to “Breakdown Tests” that would seem incredible to the average owner. They have been turned on for 24 hours a day—7 days a week —4 weeks a month. Some of these sets have been running without a moment’s pause for as much as 17 months.</p>
                <p>These sets have been tested against every conceivable type of viewing hazard. They have been tested up to 125 miles away from the station. They have been tested against the interference of an entire warehouse of electrical appliances. They have been tested in special, steel-ribbed buildings, which ordinarily would produce several distinct ghosts.</p>
                <p><strong>And, in almost every one of these cases, these sets have produced perfect, movie-clear pictures—without major breakdowns—for as much as one year! Here are some of the reasons why:</strong></p>
              </div>
              <h4 class="poster-h4">WHAT TV EXPERTS HAVE <span class="h4-breaker">LEARNED ABOUT YOUR SET</span></h4>
              <div class="rich-text w-richtext">
                <p><strong>(1) If your set is properly cared for</strong>—as these sets were cared for in these tests—it need break clown only once during the entire year! In other words, you may actually have to call in a repairman only once during the entire year. You can save the $30-$60 service fees you are now paying—and you can save most of the $10-$15 repair bills.</p>
                <p><strong>(2) If your set is properly cared for,</strong> it can actually give you perfect, movie-clear reception the other 364 days a year. It can give you this perfect reception without special electronic equipment—without the help of a repairman—up to 100 miles away from your station.</p>
                <p><strong>(3) And most important,</strong> these experts have discovered that you do not have to be a handyman or a mechanic in order to coax this performance from your set. You need no technical knowledge whatsoever. You do not even have to touch a single nut, bolt, or wire. Here&#x27;s why:</p>
              </div>
              <h4 class="poster-h4">5 MINUTES A WEEK FOR <span class="h4-breaker">PERFECT RECEPTION!</span></h4>
              <div class="rich-text w-richtext">
                <p>These television experts have discovered that your TV set is a great deal like your body in this respect—that it gives you warning signals before it has a major breakdown. For instance, after your set was installed, it probably played perfectly for the first week. But then it began to suffer from the vibration, the jarring, the interference of other electrical appliances in your home. The picture might suddenly begin to flop over or flicker—lines may appear in your screen.</p>
                <p>Now—and this is important—if you had the knowledge to quickly make a few minor adjustments, on the outside controls of your set, then you could correct those symptoms, you could keep the set playing perfectly and you could prevent major breakdowns in exactly the same way they were prevented in these manufacturer’s tests.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="rich-text para-spacer1 line-height-stretch w-richtext">
                <p>If you do not have this knowledge . . .  if you do not make these adjustments, then your set will weaken . . . you will get a constantly bad picture and you will have to call a repairman.</p>
                <p>It&#x27;s as simple as that. You pay a repairman—not for his work—but for his knowledge.</p>
