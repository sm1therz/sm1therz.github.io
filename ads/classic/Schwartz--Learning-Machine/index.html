                      <p class="body"></p>
                      <p class="body">First, turn to page 94. Read this page alone — nothing more. Then, pick up another book and read one page in it. Time yourself — find out exactly how long it took you to read that page, <i>before you tried out this simple trick:</i></p>
                      <p class="body"><i>Now, simply follow the instructions we give you to take an ordinary pencil and place it between your teeth! And NOW read another page of that same book, following the one rule we give you! Time yourself again!</i></p>

                      <p class="body">And then turned to page 139. Look over the list — <i>without ever seeing them before, and without going to the dictionary — of FIVE DIFFERENT FOUR SYLLABLE WORDS.

                      <p class="body">— <i>All from one simple change in your work habits that's so easy to do it's almost unbelievable!</i></p>
                      <p class="header_4 color-opposite">Which fields do you want to shine in? Business! Reading! Culture! Science! Social leadership!</p>
                      <p class="body">Think of it! From this moment on, in as little as five short minutes a day, you begin applying these wonder-working techniques of Power Learning to every untrained corner of your mind! You begin breaking through mental barriers — mental limitations that have been blocking your progress for years!</p>
                      <p class="body"><i>You begin tapping the buried power of your mind! Powers that you have glimpsed before in brief flashes — now brought to the surface — strengthened with simple formulas to double their potency — and placed forever at your beck and call, ready to go to work for you at the blink of an eyelash!</i></p>
                      <p class="body">For example —</p>
                      <p class="header_4 color-opposite">Do you want to develop "total concentration!"</p>
                      <p class="body">Then turn to page 31... master one simple routine... and thrill to your ability to get down to work instantly... to absorb huge amounts of information easily and swiftly — <i>even in a room filled with half a dozen howling children!</i></p>
                      <p class="header_4 color-opposite">Do you want to develop a "tape recorder memory" for the spoken word!</p>
                      <p class="body">Then turn to page 72... Read the four simple questions taught to you there... and see how those questions automatically rivet your attention to the other person's words... keep your mind from wondering... <i>lets you store up his thoughts as though they were engraved on your memory — actually amazing by quoting, almost word for word, from conversations you had with him months before!</i></p>
                      <p class="header_4 color-opposite">Do you want to develop the ability to make other people "hang on your every word!"</p>
                      <p class="body">Then turn to page 130... read every word... and see how incredibly easy it is to overcome shyness and uncertainty... to make your conversation sparkle... to think instantly on your feet... reason logically... build thought upon thought correctly and dramatically... persuade others to your point of view... <i>stand out head in shoulder above the rest of the group, every time you wish to make a point!</i></p>
                      <p class="header_4 color-opposite">Yes! And do you want to develop the ability to zoom ahead in the advancement tests, the promotion tests that are your gateway to the big money!</p>
                      <p class="body">Then get ready for the revelation of your life starting on page 229! When you put this "Test Solver" Action to work! When you're shown a five minute ritual, before you take a personality or advancement test, that breaks that test wide open! That drains fear and nervousness out of your body like magic!

                      <p class="body"></p>
