<i>Premise</i> is a <b>technical term</b>.&nbsp; In ordinary conversation people 
(mis)use it in many ways, but for us it has a specific meaning: a claim which is 
part of a reason or objection.</p>

you'll see that they are made up of distinct claims, which we call premises. </p>

<h3>Multiple Premises</h3>
<blockquote>
  <!--webbot bot="Include" U-Include="2_Multiple_premises/multiple_premises_text.htm" TAG="BODY" startspan -->

<p>Sometimes when people present reasons or objections, it is clear that they 
have provided two claims as part of a single complex piece of evidence. That is, 
they have provided <b>more than one premise</b>.&nbsp; Consider this argument:</p>
<p class="quote">When there are two or more explanations for some events, the 
least complicated is to be favoured.&nbsp; The least complicated explanation of 
the Apollo events is that the astronauts landed on the Moon. Therefore, the 
Apollo astronauts did in fact land on the moon. [based on 9.8-9]</p>
<p>I<span style="font-style: normal">n this passage, there is only one reason to 
believe the <span lang="en-au">contention</span>, but there are two distinct claims in that reason, i.e., 
two distinct premises.&nbsp; The two premises &quot;work together&quot; to support the 
<span lang="en-au">contention</span>.</span></p>
<p>We could map the argument this way, lumping all the premises together in one 
    reason box.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><img border="0" src="2_Multiple_premises/multip1.gif"></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Or we could map it by putting each premise in its own claim box.&nbsp; This 
    shows much more clearly that there are two distinct claims.</p>

There are various ways to diagram arguments with multiple premises.&nbsp; The 
particular type of diagram shown above follows the approach used in the 
<a href="http://www.reasoninglab.com/rationale">Rationale™</a> software.&nbsp; The 
crucial thing is that the diagram show that the premises belong together as part 
of one reason or objection. In the diagramming approach here, this is shown by 
the premises being enclosed within the one green area.&nbsp; You can think of 
the green area as an extension of the link between the premises and the 
contention. </p>

<h3>Co-premises</h3>
<blockquote>
  <!--webbot bot="Include" U-Include="3_Co-premises/co-premises_text.htm" TAG="BODY" startspan -->

<p>Multiple premises working together as part of a single reason or objection 
are known as <b>co-premises</b>. A co-premise helps <b>connect</b>
<span lang="en-au">(&quot;<b>co-</b>nnect&quot;) the </span>other 
premise, or premises, to the <span lang="en-au">contention</span>.&nbsp; </p>
<p><img border="0" src="3_Co-premises/co-premises1.gif" width="500" height="175"></p>

<p>
<span lang="en-au">Two premises are</span> part of the same reason or objection 
<span lang="en-au">when </span>they are <b>working 
together</b>. Roughly, two premises work together when <b>each one needs the 
other</b> <span lang="en-au">so</span> that they can, as a group, provide evidence for (or against) 
the <span lang="en-au">contention</span>.&nbsp; They don't stand alone; rather, they work hand in hand to 
show that the <span lang="en-au">contention</span> is true (or false).</p>
<p>
<span lang="en-au">Example:</span></p>
<p>
<img border="0" src="3_Co-premises/co-premises.gif" width="550" height="200"></p>
<p>
<span lang="en-au">You can see how when both of these premises are true, you 
have a reason to believe that the Apollo astronauts landed on the Moon.&nbsp; 
However if either of them is false, the other one is not enough on its own.&nbsp; 
Thus, the premises are working together. </span></p>
<p>Another intuitive way to understand this notion of co-premises working 
together is to think of a co-premise as what <b>connects</b> the other premise(s) to 
the <span lang="en-au">contention</span>.&nbsp; It makes the <b>connection</b> or bridge between claims 
which otherwise might seem unrelated or only partially related.&nbsp; </p>
<p><img border="0" src="3_Co-premises/connects.gif" width="550" height="200"></p>
<p>Don't worry too much if you're not 100% clear yet on this notion of &quot;working 
together.&quot;&nbsp; We will clarify it a lot in the following pages and tutorials.&nbsp; 
However it is worth mentioning right now that this is one of the most difficult 
of all the concepts we will deal with.&nbsp; Getting it right is one of the 
biggest challenges in argument mapping! </p>
<p>Technical point: The notion of co-premise is <i>relative</i>. Nothing can be 
a co-premise on its own, just as you can't be a husband or a sister on your own.&nbsp; 
Husbands are only husbands in relation to wives, and sisters are only sisters in 
relation to their siblings. Likewise, premises are co-premises in relation to 
other premises, as long as are part of the same reason or objection.&nbsp; Two 
premises are not co-premises in relation to each other if they belong to 
different reasons or objections. </p>
<h4>Alternative terminology</h4>
<p>Logicians use various terms to refer to co-premises.&nbsp; Some others you 
might come across are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>linked premises</li>
  <li>helping premises (Reason!Able software)</li>
</ul>

premises is the simplest and most common case. </p>

If, as the Golden Rule says, every reason or objection has at least two 
co-premises, <b>why do people usually hide</b> some of them? Often, co-premises 
are obvious or uncontroversial and don't really need to be explicitly stated.&nbsp; 
However there are many other explanations.&nbsp; People tend to be one or more 
of the following...</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Impatient</b>. Life is short and people want to move on to the next 
  thing, whatever that is. </li>
  <li><b>Lazy</b>. Who could be bothered with co-premises?</li>
  <li><b>Confused</b>.&nbsp; People are unclear about their own arguments, and 
  don't really know what their co-premises are.</li>
  <li><b>Devious</b>.&nbsp; Sometimes, people deliberately hide co-premises 
  because they know or suspect that the co-premises are false, rendering their 
  argument worthless. </li>
</ul>
<p>When people hide co-premises, they are leaving it to us, as listeners or 
readers, to <b>fill in the gaps</b>.&nbsp; This often involves a lot of effort 
and skill. </p>
<p>Since <b>argument mapping</b> is all about making the structure of reasoning 
explicit, if we are doing our job in a completely thorough way, we will identify 
all co-premises, which means <b>identifying all hidden premises</b>.&nbsp; This 
is one of the biggest challenges in argument mapping. </p>
<h4>Alternative terminology</h4>
<p>Logicians also use various other terms for hidden premises.&nbsp; Some you 
might encounter include:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>missing premises</b></li>
  <li><b>assumptions</b> - that is, claims which are <i>assumed</i> to be true 
  for the argument to work, but are not stated.&nbsp; </li>
</ul>

<p>Logicians use the term <b>enthymeme</b> for an argument with a hidden 
premise.&nbsp; Most arguments encountered in everyday contexts are enthymematic.&nbsp;

The Rabbit Rule is one of the key principles of structure for simple arguments.&nbsp; 
A fully articulated simple argument <b>MUST obey the Rabbit Rule</b>. </p>
<p>
<img border="0" src="6_Rabbit_Rule/PE01682_.gif" width="118" height="118" align="right" hspace="10"><b>Why 
is it called the Rabbit Rule</b>?&nbsp; The idea behind the rule is that you 
can't pull rabbits out of hats just by <b>magic</b>.&nbsp; If a rabbit appears 
above the hat, it must have been put in there previously.&nbsp; In argument 
mapping terms, nothing can magically appear in the <span lang="en-au">contention</span>; it must have been 
put in the premises first.&nbsp; </p>
<p>The Rabbit Rule is a very simple idea.&nbsp; However, properly applied, it 
has an amazing - almost magical! - effect in <b>forcing hidden premises out into 
the open</b>.&nbsp; But the simplicity of the Rabbit Rule is in a way 
misleading.&nbsp; Applying it properly is often a lot harder than you would 
expect.</p>
<p>Corresponding to the Rabbit Rule there is the <b>Rabbit Test</b>.&nbsp; This 
is a simple test to determine whether you have a properly structured argument.&nbsp; 
To apply the Rabbit test, just examine the <span lang="en-au">contention</span> to see if there are any 
significant terms or concepts which appear there but not in any premise.&nbsp; 
If there are any, the argument fails the Rabbit Test. </p>
<p>Applying the Rabbit Test will give you clues as to what is going to have to 
go in any additional co-premises required to make the argument properly 
structured. </p>

<h3>Using the Rabbit Rule</h3>

<p>
The Rabbit Rule gives us strong clues as to what the missing co-premise should 
be, but it doesn't mechanically determine the outcome.&nbsp; We still have to 
think hard about it to come up with a proper sentence which uses one or more of 
the terms or concepts from the conclusion, and also makes sense in the context 
of the argument.&nbsp; </p>
<p>When adding co-premises, you do need to be careful what you add.&nbsp; A poor 
choice of co-premise will create as many problems as it solves, for as we will 
soon see, any terms or concepts in the premises also have to be properly tied in 
to the rest of the argument.&nbsp; </p>

Where the Rabbit Rule helps ensure that the <span lang="en-au">contention</span> is appropriately tied to 
the premises, the Holding Hands rule helps ensure that the premises are 
appropriately tied to each other. </p>
<p>Corresponding to the Holding Hands Rule there is the <b>Holding Hands Test</b>.&nbsp; 
This is a simple test to determine whether you have a properly structured 
argument.&nbsp; To apply the Holding Hands test, just examine the premises to 
see if there are any significant terms or concepts which appear there but not in 
the <span lang="en-au">contention</span> or any other premise.&nbsp; If there are any, the argument fails 
the Test. </p>
<p>Applying the Holding Hands Test will give you clues as to what is going to 
have to go in any additional co-premises required to make the argument properly 
structured. </p>

<p><span lang="en-au">Note that the Holding Hands rule applies <i>within</i> a 
single reason or objection.&nbsp; That is, any significant term or concept which 
appears in one premise must appear in another premise (or the contention) in the

A <b>dangler</b> is something that dangles, i.e.,
<a title="Warning: Nudity" href="9_No_Danglers/nutsac.gif">hangs loose</a>.&nbsp; A dangler is 
a significant word, term, phrase or concept which <b>appears only once in a 
simple argument</b>, without being &quot;tied in&quot; by also appearing somewhere else.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>The No Danglers rule is <b>equivalent</b> to the Rabbit Rule and the Holding 
Hands rule combined.&nbsp; In theory you could forget the other two rules and 
just apply No Danglers.&nbsp; However we find that it <b>works most effectively 
to treat them separately</b>; first apply Rabbit, then Holding Hands. </p>
<p>The overall effect of applying these rules is a very tightly structured 
argument, in which all hidden premises have been made explicit.&nbsp; The No 
Danglers rule is a powerful tool for ensuring that we have all and only the 
right claims when we map a simple argument. </p>
<p>It is important to realize that these structure principles <b>do not 
guarantee that the argument is a good one</b>.&nbsp; They help make it fully 
explicit; whether it provides strong evidence is another question, one we can 
address more easily once these rules have been applied, but which brings further 
considerations into play. </p>
