    Similarly, in this argument the objection is a general objection to the Moon 
    landing; the supporting reason is a more specific piece of evidence 
    supporting the general objection.&nbsp; There might also be <i>other</i> 
    reasons to think that The astronauts cannot have been to the Moon. </p>

argument tree observes this aspect of the Pyramid Rule.&nbsp; Fortunately, the 
lower the level, the less important this principle is. The upper levels of an 
argument tree determine its overall structure, and getting things right at those 
upper levels helps ensure that it is constructed solidly, even if it is a bit 
messy on the periphery. </p>

It is <b>rare</b> for an argument map to take on a perfect pyramidal shape.&nbsp; 
Some branches of the argument tend to be wider or longer than others.&nbsp; 
Nevertheless you should keep the pyramid image in mind because it is the <b>
ideal</b> to which maps of real arguments approximate when they have a proper 
macrostructure.</p>

<p>The &quot;mutually exclusive&quot; rule does not mean that there can never be <i>any</i> 
conceptual overlap within a group.&nbsp; Sometimes terms or concepts may appear 
in more than one reason or objection.&nbsp; In fact, given that the Rabbit Rule 
should be observed with regard to each and every reason and objection in the 
group, there should be <i>some</i> conceptual overlap.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>It does mean that reasons and objections should be <b>genuinely distinct</b> 
from each other, even if they have some concepts in common. Informally, they <b>
should not be making the same point</b>, wholly or even partially.&nbsp; </p>

exclusive.&nbsp; It is particularly hard to notice when there are also level 
problems, i.e., the Pyramid rule has not been properly observed. For example</p>

<h4>
Example</h4>
<p>On p.9 of <i>Apollo Moon Landings</i>, the author asks &quot;What evidence is 
there that the Apollo Moon landings actually took place?&quot; </p>
<p>Three separate issues are considered; Moon rocks, telescope photos, and &quot;Occam's 
Razor.&quot;&nbsp; If you look closely at the discussion of telescope photos, you'll 
see that it does not actually present evidence that the Apollo Moon landings 
took place; rather, it explains why a certain category of possible evidence is 
not available.&nbsp; So really only two arguments are raised:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><img border="0" src="6_MECE_CE/MECE_C3.gif" width="248" height="230"></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Note that the Occam's Razor reason needs further elaboration; only the first 
premise has been provided here, and the co-premises are needed for the reason to 
make sense.) </p>
<p>The important issue here is whether the argument is Collectively Exhaustive - 
that is, whether the group of considerations currently listed as bearing on the 
main <span lang="en-au">contention.</span> </p>
<p>Even if you consider only the supporting evidence (i.e., ignoring all the 
objections for the moment), <b>the argument is not collectively exhaustive</b>.&nbsp; 
There are other reasons to believe that the Apollo astronauts landed on the 
Moon.</p>
<p>For example, one very general kind of argument that the Apollo astronauts 
landed on the Moon goes along these lines: landing on the Moon was an enormously 
important political goal, and the U.S. had the technical capacity to achieve it.&nbsp; 
Thus, it is likely that the Apollo astronauts did in fact land on the Moon.</p>
<p>When this reason is added, the argument map looks like this:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><img border="0" src="6_MECE_CE/MECE_C4.gif" width="369" height="230"></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This reason may be somewhat controversial, but a complete argument map 
considers <i>all</i> arguments, not only the ones deemed to be good by a 
particular observer. </p>
<p>You may want to consider if there are any other arguments, at this level, 
which should be added:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><img border="0" src="6_MECE_CE/MECE_C5.gif" width="465" height="230"></p>
</blockquote>
<h4>ALL the arguments</h4>
<p>&quot;Collectively exhaustive&quot; means that the group covers ALL the arguments.&nbsp; 
It is an interesting question what <i>all</i> means here. Roughly, it means <b>
all relevant, serious arguments</b>.&nbsp; These include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>any argument raised by any contributor to the debate</li>
  <li>any argument that <b>you can think of</b>, over and above those raised by 
  others.</li>
  <li>arguments which are relevant even if you happen to think that they are 
  pretty weak</li>
</ul>
<p>There is no need to put on the map considerations which are obviously 
completely irrelevant or absurd. </p>

In ordinary conversation, the term <i>debate</i> is often used quite loosely to 
refer to just about any argumentative disagreement. Here, we are giving it a 
more <b>precise</b> <b>technical definition</b>.&nbsp; It is an argument 
structure of a certain sort.&nbsp; </p>
<p>A debate in this sense is, roughly, where each side actually responds to the 
(top level) moves made by the other side.&nbsp; It is not enough for you to 
provide your reasons to accept the conclusion and for me to provide my 
objections to it.&nbsp; Rather, I must actually respond to your reasons - and 
you must respond to my objections.&nbsp; In other words, in<b> a genuine debate, 
each side takes the other side's <i>arguments</i> seriously</b>, not just their 
position.&nbsp; </p>
<p>The concept of a debate is important because, all too often, people 
concentrate on mounting their own arguments, and fail to challenge what the 
other side says, even if the other side has very powerful arguments.</p>
<p>For example, the Hoax Believers tend to focus all their attention on their 
own arguments that the Moon landings were a hoax, and neglect the powerful 
arguments that the Apollo Moon landings really happened.</p>
