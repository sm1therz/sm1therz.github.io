<h3>What they cover</h3>
<p>These tutorials cover the basics of argument mapping.&nbsp; More precisely, 
they cover two related topics:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The basic <b>structure of reasoning and argument</b> in ordinary language.&nbsp; 
  This is the fundamental stuff <b>everyone should know</b> about how arguments 
  are constructed.&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp;</li>
  <li>How to <b>produce diagrams</b> (maps) of that structure.&nbsp; Argument 
  mapping is a helpful technique for understanding the structure.&nbsp; </li>
</ul>
<p>These two topics are heavily interdependent.&nbsp; It is very difficult to 
get clear about the structure - either the general principles, or the detailed 
structure in particular cases - without an effective technique such as argument 
mapping.&nbsp; Conversely, you can't produce good argument maps unless you have 
a good grip on the fundamentals of the structure. </p>
<p>There are two large topics which are <b>not treated</b> in these tutorials, 
even though they are very important:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Evaluation</b>. These tutorials say almost nothing about how to tell if 
  reasoning is any good.&nbsp; They are concerned with structure, not quality.&nbsp; 
  However clarity about structure is essential if you want to make sound 
  judgments about quality. <br>
&nbsp;</li>
  <li><b>Identifying arguments</b>.&nbsp; One of the hardest parts of argument 
  mapping - indeed, one of the hardest of all intellectual tasks - is figuring 
  out the reasoning buried in what somebody says or writes.&nbsp; A lot can be 
  said on this topic; indeed, there could easily be another six tutorials on 
  that topic alone.&nbsp; In these tutorials, many of the examples and exercises 
  involve reasoning as presented in written prose.&nbsp; However the focus is 
  always on the essentials of argument structure, rather than the myriad issues 
  involved in interpreting the prose.&nbsp; Very often, the prose has been 
  modified so as to make interpretation easier.&nbsp; </li>
</ul>
<h3>How they work</h3>
<p>Each tutorial has two main parts:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Theory</b>, covering key principles and concepts<br>
&nbsp;</li>
  <li><b>Exercises</b>, including a quiz.&nbsp; </li>
</ul>
<p>Argument mapping is a <b>complex skill</b>, and these tutorials are designed 
to help you become proficient in that skill.&nbsp; Thus, the <b>exercises are 
crucial</b>.&nbsp; Don't make the mistake of reading the theory, and then just 
skimming over the exercises assuming that you've already got the idea.&nbsp; Do 
the exercises properly, and be sure to make your best attempt on each exercise 
before looking at the model answers.&nbsp; When doing the exercises, feel free 
to refer back to the theory pages whenever you feel like it. </p>
<p>In the theory part, central principles are wherever possible <b>presented 
using a diagram</b>, with a minimum of accompanying text.&nbsp; The basic idea 
is that you should be able to look at the diagram at the top part of each theory 
page and get the essential idea.&nbsp; Further down the page you will find some 
discussion which may help you understand the principle better. </p>
<p>The tutorials are <b>progressive</b>.&nbsp; That is, each tutorial builds on 
the previous one.&nbsp; You should try to master the material in one tutorial 
before moving on to the next one. </p>
