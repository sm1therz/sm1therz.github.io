      <p>This argument map is the model answer from Exercise 3.5:</p>

      <p>It lists all the objections to the claim that the Apollo astronauts landed on the Moon from pages 3-8 of <em>Apollo Moon Landings</em>.</p>
      <p>Revise this argument map so that it observes the <strong><a href="https://app.heptabase.com/8167b54f-d61a-4931-875a-3df1e49cfc74/card/9a8d5ccc-e90f-400a-8afc-c22a5b2f33a2">Pyramid </a><a href="https://app.heptabase.com/8167b54f-d61a-4931-875a-3df1e49cfc74/card/485aa0d6-a680-4f03-921d-76a2462176e2">Rule</a>.</strong></p>
      <h4 id="answer">Answer</h4>
      <p>Lets start from the beginning and work through this step by step. Recall that:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>The <strong><a href="https://app.heptabase.com/8167b54f-d61a-4931-875a-3df1e49cfc74/card/9a8d5ccc-e90f-400a-8afc-c22a5b2f33a2">Pyramid</a> <a href="https://app.heptabase.com/8167b54f-d61a-4931-875a-3df1e49cfc74/card/485aa0d6-a680-4f03-921d-76a2462176e2">Rule</a></strong>: More general or abstract considerations should appear higher in the argument tree, and considerations at the same level of the tree should be at roughly the same level of generality or abstraction. </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>The easiest way forward is to start with the second aspect of the rule. Are all considerations at the primary level, roughly the same level of generality or abstraction? Or are some more detailed and particular than others? Scan across the full set of objections and compare them from the point of view of their level of generality.</p>
      <p>It is soon obvious that the answer is no; some considerations are more general than others. Lets roughly sort them into three bins, from less general to more general:</p>
      <table>
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th>
              <h4 id="less-general">Less General</h4>
            </th>
            <th>
              <h4 id="more-general">More General</h4>
            </th>
            <th>
              <h4 id="most-general">Most General</h4>
            </th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td>
              <p>#1 no stars in pictures</p>
              <p>#2 no dust on footpads</p>

            <td>
              <p>#4 Apollo pictures taken in a studio on Earth (lighting)</p>

              <p>#9 LRV could not have been transported to the Moon</p>
            </td>
            <td>
              <p>#6 astronauts cannot have been to Moon</p>
              <p>#8 equipment could not have functioned<!--ï¿¼-->
              </p>
            </td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
      <p>#1 no stars in pictures</p>
      <p>#2 no dust on footpads</p>
      <p>#3 no blast crater</p>
      <p>#4 Apollo pictures taken in a studio on Earth (lighting)</p>
      <p>#5 American flag scenes filmed on Earth</p>
      <p>#7 lunar surface pictures tampered with</p>
      <p>#9 LRV could not have been transported to the Moon</p>
      <p>#6 astronauts cannot have been to Moon</p>
      <p>#8 equipment could not have functioned</p>
      <p>You can probably now see how some are more general than others. Part of what this means is that the more detailed considerations do not really bear directly on the main contention; they are part of the evidence for some more general claim which does bear directly on the main contention.</p>
      <p>Here is another version of the table, this time putting each consideration on its own row (and with a little re-ordering):</p>

      <p>On the argument map, then, we need one more primary objection:</p>
      <p><img alt="image 5.png" data-featherlight="Exercise-6-1-assets/image-5.png" src="Exercise-6-1-assets/image-5.png" /></p>
      <p>Objections #4, 5 and 7 evidence for this new primary objection, and so should be moved below it <em>as reasons<strong>:</strong></em></p>
      <p><img alt="image 6.png" data-featherlight="Exercise-6-1-assets/image-6.png" src="Exercise-6-1-assets/image-6.png" /></p>
      <p>Making these moves, and adding another reason (Apollo scenes were artificially created) we get:</p>
      <p><img alt="image 7.png" data-featherlight="Exercise-6-1-assets/image-7.png" src="Exercise-6-1-assets/image-7.png" /></p>
      <p>The next thing to do is to move #1, 2 and 3 under their "parent" reason:</p>
      <p><img alt="image 8.png" data-featherlight="Exercise-6-1-assets/image-8.png" src="Exercise-6-1-assets/image-8.png" /></p>
      <p>Resulting in:</p>
      <p><img alt="image 9.png" data-featherlight="Exercise-6-1-assets/image-9.png" src="Exercise-6-1-assets/image-9.png" /></p>
      <p>At this stage the only problem is #9. There is a <a href="https://app.heptabase.com/8167b54f-d61a-4931-875a-3df1e49cfc74/card/dcbce5b9-60a6-4526-8ecc-842dbd633d8a">missing layer</a> between it and the main contention - the claim that the Apollo equipment could not have been transported to the Moon. Adding this primary objection, and shifting #9 below it as a reason, we get:</p>
      <p><img alt="image 10.png" data-featherlight="Exercise-6-1-assets/image-10.png" src="Exercise-6-1-assets/image-10.png" /></p>
      <p><em>And then the final below</em></p>
      <hr />
      <p>Notice two things about this new argument tree:</p>
      <p>(1) The primary objections form a smaller, more coherent set. Previously the primary considerations were a dog's breakfast. Now they suggest a <strong>well-ordered mind at work</strong>. The Apollo astronauts did not land on the Moon, because</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>They could not have been to the Moon;</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>They could not have transported their equipment there;</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>The equipment could not have functioned, if taken there; and</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>The evidence that they were there was faked.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Looking at it this way makes much more sense of the overall case made by the hoax believers.</p>
      <p>(2) The revised argument map is <em>closer</em> to a <strong>pyramid</strong> <strong>shape</strong> than the one we started with. It is not yet a perfect pyramid, and probably never will be, but it is heading in that direction. Once the rest of the arguments have been added to the map, it will look still more like a pyramid.</p>

      <p>Take the argument map from the model answer to Exercise 6.1 and improve it by applying the first (ME) part of the MECE rule.</p>
      <h4 id="answer">Answer</h4>
      <p>Applying the ME part of the MECE rule results in a slightly reduced tree:</p>
      <p><img alt="image 11.png" data-featherlight="Exercise-6-2-assets/image-11.png" src="Exercise-6-2-assets/image-11.png" /></p>
      <p>Whereas there were four reasons in one group at the second level, two of them were basically the same point so have been consolidated. The other groups already were ME.</p>
      <h4 id="discussion">Discussion</h4>
      <p>This is the argument map, with all <strong>groups</strong> marked:</p>
      <p><img alt="image 12.png" data-featherlight="Exercise-6-2-assets/image-12.png" src="Exercise-6-2-assets/image-12.png" /></p>
      <p>The MECE rule applies to groups of considerations, so lets consider the groups one by one.</p>
      <h4 id="-group-https-app-heptabase-com-8167b54f-d61a-4931-875a-3df1e49cfc74-card-12abf7f6-a3fb-403a-a9dd-63cc45bd4f61-1"><a href="https://app.heptabase.com/8167b54f-d61a-4931-875a-3df1e49cfc74/card/12abf7f6-a3fb-403a-a9dd-63cc45bd4f61">Group</a> 1</h4>
      <p>Are these objections all completely distinct from each other? Are any two of them just variants on each other, or perhaps support for a more general objection?</p>
      <p>In this case, they are in fact genuinely distinct from each other. There is no sensible way to reduce the set without losing something.</p>
      <h4 id="-group-https-app-heptabase-com-8167b54f-d61a-4931-875a-3df1e49cfc74-card-12abf7f6-a3fb-403a-a9dd-63cc45bd4f61-2"><a href="https://app.heptabase.com/8167b54f-d61a-4931-875a-3df1e49cfc74/card/12abf7f6-a3fb-403a-a9dd-63cc45bd4f61">Group</a> 2</h4>
      <p>The ME (mutually exclusive) part of the MECE rule is concerned with the overlap between considerations within a group, so we can set Group 2 aside (for the while at least).</p>
      <h4 id="-group-https-app-heptabase-com-8167b54f-d61a-4931-875a-3df1e49cfc74-card-12abf7f6-a3fb-403a-a9dd-63cc45bd4f61-3"><a href="https://app.heptabase.com/8167b54f-d61a-4931-875a-3df1e49cfc74/card/12abf7f6-a3fb-403a-a9dd-63cc45bd4f61">Group</a> 3</h4>
      <p>Things start to get interesting here, so lets have a look at this group on its own:</p>
      <p><img alt="image 13.png" data-featherlight="Exercise-6-2-assets/image-13.png" src="Exercise-6-2-assets/image-13.png" /></p>
      <p>There is obvious similarity among these reasons. Of course they must be somewhat similar, because they are all evidence for the same claim. However there seems to be a bit of redundancy in the expression of the evidence.</p>
      <p>There are really three key ideas:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Scenes were artificially created</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>The photos and video footage were taken on earth</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Photos were manipulated</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>These three points are genuinely distinct from each other. Comparing these with the four reasons, it becomes apparent that the first two are really too close to each other to be worth mapping separately. A better argument map is:</p>
      <p><img alt="image 14.png" data-featherlight="Exercise-6-2-assets/image-14.png" src="Exercise-6-2-assets/image-14.png" /></p>
      <p>This is now a simpler, more clear MECE set of considerations.</p>
      <p>You might think that in reducing the set of considerations we have lost something. In particular, there is no longer any mention of the American flag. What happened to that?</p>
      <p>The answer is that the American flag evidence should appear at a lower level, as a reason to think that the pictures and footage were created on Earth.</p>
      <h4 id="group-4">Group 4</h4>
      <p>The considerations in this group are in fact distinct from each other; each one makes a different point. </p>
      <p>The first two are both concerned with dust, and you might consider whether they should both be subordinate (beneath) a slightly more general reason, something like: The Apollo landing did not create the expected impacts on the lunar dust.</p>
      <h4 id="so-">So...</h4>
      <p>Applying the ME part of the MECE rule, we can reduce Group 3.</p>
    </div>
    <!--SECTION-->
    <div id="section-3">
      <h1 id="-exercise-6-3-https-www-rationaleonline-com-explore-en-tutorials-tutorials-tutorial_6-exercises-6_3-6_3-htm-"><a href="https://www.rationaleonline.com/explore/en/tutorials/tutorials/Tutorial_6/Exercises/6_3/6_3.htm">Exercise 6.3</a></h1>
      <p>Take the argument map from the model answer to Exercise 6.3 and improve it by applying the second (CE) part of the MECE rule.</p>
      <h4 id="answer">Answer</h4>
      <p>Applying the CE part of the MECE rule results in this expanded map:</p>
      <p><img alt="image.png" data-featherlight="Exercise-6-3-assets/image.png" src="Exercise-6-3-assets/image.png" /></p>
      <p>A primary objection, with supporting reason, has been added because the set of primary objections was not collectively exhaustive.</p>
      <h4 id="discussion">Discussion</h4>
      <p><img alt="image 1.png" data-featherlight="Exercise-6-3-assets/image-1.png" src="Exercise-6-3-assets/image-1.png" /></p>
      <p>Again, we should consider each of these groups individually.</p>
      <h4 id="-group-https-app-heptabase-com-8167b54f-d61a-4931-875a-3df1e49cfc74-card-12abf7f6-a3fb-403a-a9dd-63cc45bd4f61-1"><a href="https://app.heptabase.com/8167b54f-d61a-4931-875a-3df1e49cfc74/card/12abf7f6-a3fb-403a-a9dd-63cc45bd4f61">Group</a> 1</h4>
      <p>Recall that the CE part of the MECE rule says that a group should be Collectively Exhaustive, i.e., should include all the relevant arguments. </p>
      <p>Restricting ourselves for the moment to objections, is this set complete? Has anything been missed?</p>
      <p>Yes, something has been missed - an objection which can be found in the text of <em>Apollo Moon Landings</em> itself. The arguments we have been considering have been drawn from pages 3 to 8. Page 9 is given over to providing evidence <em>for</em> the Moon landings, but one objection does get raised and rebutted, in paragraphs 4-6. This is the objection that NASA cannot produce photos taken with the space telescope. It should be entered onto the map:</p>
      <p><img alt="image 2.png" data-featherlight="Exercise-6-3-assets/image-2.png" src="Exercise-6-3-assets/image-2.png" /></p>
      <p>As soon as we do this, however, it becomes apparent that the Pyramid Rule is being violated. The new objection is not at the same level of generality as the others. However it does suggest a more general objection, one which stands alongside the other primary objections:</p>
      <p><img alt="image 3.png" data-featherlight="Exercise-6-3-assets/image-3.png" src="Exercise-6-3-assets/image-3.png" /></p>
      <p>Are there any other objections missing? None that I know of. It is possible to imagine other objections, but these are not worth taking seriously. Other significant objections may come to light in the future, but at this time the set looks CE.</p>
      <p>This discussion has only considered whether the set of objections collectively exhausts all the objections to the main contention. To complete the process, we would have to look in a similar fashion at the <strong>reasons</strong> which support the main contention. </p>

      <p>Each of groups 2, 3 and 4 appears to be collectively exhaustive with respect to the evidence raised in the text of <em>Apollo Moon Landings</em>. </p>
      <p>To determine whether they are collectively exhaustive in a more definitive sense, we would have to look at other potential sources of evidence, such as writings by hoax believers. That task is outside the scope of these tutorials.</p>
      <h4 id="supporting-evidence">Supporting Evidence</h4>
      <p>A great deal of evidence which is brought up Apollo Moon Landings case does not yet appear on the map. The hoax believers, as represented in the article, present supporting evidence for many of the reasons and objections on the map. Thus the current map is certainly not complete.</p>
      <p>The task before us in this exercise was not to produce a complete map (see next exercise) but rather to practice applying the MECE principles.</p>
