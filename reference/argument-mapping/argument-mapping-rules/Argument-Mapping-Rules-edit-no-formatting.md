# Argument Mapping: Rules 
- The Golden Rule
   - a simple argument, **always has** 2 Co-premises.
- The Rabbit Rule
   - Any significant word or concept, **that appears in** the contention, **must also appear in,**  one of the premises.
- Holding Hands
   - Any significant word or concept **that appears in**  a premise, **but not in** the contention, **must also appear** **in**  another premise.
- No Dangler Rule 
   - Any significant word or concept **that appears in**  a claim of a simple argument, **must also appear** **in**,  another claim.
   
***

All of these rules then mean:

   
- In a well-structured simple argument:
   - every significant term or concept **must appear in** at least 2 claims *(contention or premises)*.
