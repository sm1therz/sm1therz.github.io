# Argument Mapping: Terms

- **claim**
   - an idea that somebody says is true
- **contention**
   - a claim that is supported by evidence.
   
***
- **reason**
   - evidence (supporting the claim)
   - eg, a “grouping” of claims to prove contention
   - A reason is just a set of claims, working together, to prove that, another claim is true. 
- **objection** 
   - evidence that opposes the claim
   - eg, a “grouping” of claims to disprove contention
   - An objection is just a set of claims, working together, to prove that, another claim is false. 
- **evidence**
   - a set of claims**,**** **that work together, to prove that another claim is true or false. 
---
- **simple argument**
   - an argument that has  
      **a single piece of evidence**  
      bearing upon  
      **a single** contention.  
   - Also
      - a contention with  
         a single reason for it or,  
         a single objection against it.
   - What makes an argument simple?
      - It’s an argument that has  
         **just one** contention &  
         **just one ** piece of evidence ➜
---
- **premise**
   - a claim *inside* of or *part* of  
      a reason or objection ⚠
- **co-premise**
   - a claim inside of or part of  
      a reason or objection  
      that works with another claim (co-premise)  
      to prove the contention. 
- **hidden premise**
   - a co-premise that isn’t stated in a reason or objection
---
- **multi-reason argument**
   - an argument that has  
      at least two distinct pieces of evidence  
      for the same contention ➜ 
   - For example… 
      - This is a multi-reason argument…  
         *Can be two separate reasons…*
         !image.png
         it presents two separate reasons for the **same contention** ➜ 
      - This is a multi-reason argument…  
         *Can be a reason and objection…*
         !image 1.png
         - This multi-reason argument is a *dispute* - there is evidence both for and against the conclusion. 
            ➜ 
- **counter argument**
   - a simple argument that has  
      the same contention  
      as another simple argument  
      **but opposing** evidence.
   - These are counter arguments…
      
   - These are counter arguments…
      
   - A counter-argument IS ALSO…
      - an objection to a reason's contention, and/or vice versa. ➜ 
      - The things that are inside disputes
- **dispute**
   - an argument that has  
      at least one  reason for AND  
      at least one  objection against,  
      the same  contention ➜
   - A dispute is also…
      - A multi-reason argument ➜ 
- **strange bedfellows**
   - two co-premises  
      mapped inside the same reason  
      that actually, belong in  
      different reasons
- **stranded co-premise**
   - two co-premises  
      mapped inside different reasons  
      that actually belong in  
      the same reason
---
- **multi-layer argument**
   - An argument where  
      one reason provides evidence in support of  
      another reason.
   - A multi-layer argument is also
      - an argument that has evidence for evidence
      - An argument with  
         evidence that proves  
         other evidence
      - An argument that has  
         layers of evidence  
         supporting other evidence
      - an argument that provides evidence for other evidence
      - An argument that has  
         reasons or objections  
         providing evidence for  
         other reasons or objections
      - an argument in which there are reasons or objections bearing upon reasons or objections ➜ 
- **main contention**
   - the only contention  
      that is not also a premise  
      in another simple argument.
   - eg…
      - top level contention
- **main reason**
   - the first and most important reason, at the top level, that seeks to provide evidence that the contention is true ▹▹ 
- secondary reason
   - evidence that proves  
      a premise  
      in the primary reason
   - function:
      - the secondary reason  
         is a simple argument ➜
      - the secondary reason’s contention  
         is one of the premises  
         in the primary reason ➜
      - that means…
      - a secondary reason provides support for / proves the primary reason ➜
- **main premise**
   - the first and most important claim in a reason or objection ▹▹ 
- supporting evidence
   - a layer of evidence  
      that supports/proves  
      other evidence
+ supporting evidence types
   - **reason for a reason**
      - a reason that supports another reason.
      - function:
         - *Evidence that proves another reason*
      - The contention of a supporting reason  
         is a premise in upper reason. ➜ 
         - 2 simple arguments mapped separately
            
         - Mapped as a single multi-layer argument
            
   - **reason for an objection**
      - a reason that supports an objection
      - function:
         - Evidence that backs up an objection
         - provides evidence that the objection is a good one. ➜
   - **rejoinder**
      - an objection to a reason
      - function:
         - provides evidence that a reason is not good evidence for the argument above it. ➜
            !image 2.png
      - 2 kinds of rejoinders
         - first kind provides evidence that one of the claims (co-premises) in the reason is not true ➜
            !image 3.png
         - second kind provides evidence that the claims (co-premise(s), *even if true*, don't provide good evidence for their contention ➜
            !image 4.png
   - **rebuttal**
      - an objection to an objection
      - function:
         - A rebuttal provides evidence that an objection is not a good objection ➜
            - eg. not good evidence against its contention.
         - A rebuttal (if good) "cancels out" rather than supports the first objection. ➜
         - A rebuttal basically says "the first objection is not a good objection." ➜
- **chains of reasoning**
   - a multi-layer argument  
      with more than two layers
   - a chain of reasoning is also…
      - a multi-layer argument
      - At least two simple arguments combined into a single, multi-level argument
         
         Separate ➜
         !image 5.png
         Combined ➜
         !image 6.png

   - an argument that is both  
      a multi-reason argument, and  
      a multi-layer argument.
---
- premise objection
   - an objection to a  
      stated premise  ▹▹ 
- inference objection
   - an objection to  
      **an unstated** premise ▹▹ 
   - Note… 
      - an inference objection is not aimed at any specific premise. ▹▹ 
      - An inference objection is not aimed at a visible premise.   
         **It *is* aimed at at a premise that has not yet been stated. **▹▹ 
- premise rebuttal
   - an objection to  
      another stated objection
   - Difference between a “premise objection” vs “premise rebuttal”?
      - any objection to a premise is a premise objection ▹▹ 
- inference rebuttal
   - an objection to  
      another, unstated objection
---
- 4 Kinds of multi-layer arguments ➜
   - reason for a reason, 
   - reason for an objection, 
   - rejoinder
   - rebuttal
- support vs co-premise
   - ➜ 
- multi-layer arguments have multiple contentions 
   ➜

+ #### Misc
   - a reason is made up of at least 2 distinct claims
      - every reason and objection is made up of at least two distinct claims, known as co-premises ⚠
   - In this passage, there is only 1 reason to believe… but there are 2 claims in that reason...  ⚠
      - In this passage, there is only one reason to believe the contention, but there are two distinct claims in that reason, i.e., two distinct premises. 
         - *Eg, there is only one piece of “evidence”…*
            - a reason is evidence.
         - *EG, but there are two distinct claims in that ‘evidence’*
            - eg, there are two co-premises
   - If both are true you have a ‘reason to believe’ 
      - If both premises are true, you have a reason to believe the claim  ⚠️ 
   - argument mapping
      - Argument mapping is about making the reasoning explicit ⚠
      - When you hide co-premises, you leave it up to your reader to figure it out. ⚠
